in this chapter we will talk about anonymous and callback function 

//anonymous and callback function

Anonymous function - these functions does not have a name. They are generally used as an argument or assigned to a variable 


For example - 

Const add = function (a,b) {return a+b}; 

In this example function(a,b) is anonymous. 

Callback function - it is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is intended to be called back at a later time.
