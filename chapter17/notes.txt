in this chapter , we will be talking about middlewares

in contrast to webdevelopoment , middlewares are basically the functions which comes between the request - response cycle.
in javascript , the concept of middlewares is mainly used in frameworks called express js . 

for example we want to check for each incoming request that comes to the sever that ( whether the user is above 18 or not) 

so for that we will use middleware something like : 

const express = require('express'); 
const app = express(); 

const http = require('http'); 

const server = http.createServer(app); 


const ageMiddleware = (req,res,next) => 
  { const {age} = req.body ; 
  if(age >=18) next(); 


  return res.json('400', 'your are not allowed kitten');

}


app.use(ageMiddleware); 

app.get('/', (req,res) => {

    res.json('hello from the server'); 

    });

server.listen(3000, ()=> console.log('server is listening on port 3000'));
